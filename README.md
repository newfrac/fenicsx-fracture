# NewFrac FEniCSx Training
## 30th March 2021 at Sorbonnes Université

This repository contains material for a day-long course on using DOLFINx,
the computational problem solving environment of the FEniCS Project. The
focus will be on solving problems arising in solid mechanics.

This repository automatically generates a jupyter-book here: https://newfrac.gitlab.io/newfrac-fenicsx-training/
### Running the notebooks (to be tested *prior* to course start)

Students should execute the notebooks using a Docker container running on
their own computers.

1. Install Docker following the instructions at
   https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop.

2. Clone this repository using git:

       git clone https://gitlab.com/newfrac/newfrac-fenicsx-training.git

3. Run `./launch_container.sh`.

4. You should be able to see the JupyterLab instance by navigating to
   https://localhost:8888 in your web browser.

5. The JupyterLab session will ask you for a token (password). This can be
   found in the output from the terminal and will look like e.g.
   `b64972b8b7df3717089c4899bd028f5e2df6a73a845cb250`.

Although we recommend using Docker locally, you can also use the cloud-based binder service to execute the notebooks:

### Prerequisite knowledge

The course will assume basic knowledge of the theory of finite elasticity and
finite element methods. We will also assume that the students have taken the
NEWFRAC Core School 2021 *Basic computational methods for fracture mechanics*.
Basic knowledge of Python will be assumed, see https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython
to brush up if you feel unsure.
